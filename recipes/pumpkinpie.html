<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pumpkin pie is a delicious dessert for Thanksgiving or anytime. 
    Pair it with whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, 
    or simply serve it on its own.</p>
<p>This recipe comes from Vincent Price's "Come Into The Kitchen" 
    book of recipes. It's unusual in that it contains no cinnamon! 
    Instead it uses ground mace, ginger, and nutmeg.</p>
<p>I make this pie every year and my family loves it!</p>
