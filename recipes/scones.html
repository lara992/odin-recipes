<h1>Scones</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>These scones make for a delicious breakfast and can be whipped 
    up in a snap. Add currants, raisins, toasted nuts, or simply 
    make them plain - they're excellent no matter what. I like to 
    add toasted sliced almonds and top them with raspberry jam.
</p>

<p>This recipe calls for buttermilk, which give the scones a rich, 
    soft yet crumbly texture. I always use full-fat buttermilk when
    I make them. It can be a little more difficult to find, but worth
    it in my opinion.
